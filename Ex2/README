=============================
I chose an abstract class - SpaceShip, for the design of my program. I think it's most suitable
because all the different kinds of ships are of the same thing. Additionally, an instance of SpaceShip
doesn't make any sense.
The program's built and design are easy to understand - SpaceWars acts as the "driver" of the game,
SpaceShipFactory is responsible for creating all the instances and SpaceShip is the super class
of all kinds of ships. Moreover, creating new ships with different abilities is pretty easy, as I
did with the SpecialShip and the DrunkardShip.



=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
* SpecialShip - This spaceship constantly floats in the space, unless it gets hit (by a shot or a collision)
                by an opponent. When this happens, it starts pursuing the closest ship, and when it's
                angle to the closest ship is less than 0.18 radians, it will attempt to fire.
                If it gets within a distance of 0.19 units from the opponent, it will attempt to activate
                its shields. In addition, if the SpecialShip collides with the opponent while its shields
                are activated, it disables the opponent - i.e. it won't be able to move at all for a period
                of 35 rounds. At last, it stops pursuing the opponent only when it dies.
* DrunkardShip - This spaceship constantly accelerates, spins and emits bullets, as it's name describes.
* I kept track of the rounds by creating a data member - currentRound. It helped me, for example,
  to know when a fire was shot and how many rounds passed since that shot.
