=============================
Book.java - Represents a specific copy of a book that a library can hold.
Patron.java - Represents a library patron that has a name and assigns values to different
              literary aspects of books.
Library.java - Each library can hold a certain number of books, and manage a certain number of patrons
               registered to it.


=============================
=          Design           =
=============================
The Patron class uses the Book class in order to determine if a patron will enjoy a specific book.
The library class uses both the Book class and the Patron class in order to register patrons
to libraries, and let them do different actions with the books.


=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
In the Library class I used the arrays, bookStorage and patronsRegistered, to represent book IDs
and patron IDs. The arrays contain Book and Patron instances, and each index of an array represents an ID.
Moreover, I used the array - booksPatronBorrowed, which it's indices represent a patron's ID
and each element shows how many books the patron has borrowed.
I also made sure each library has her unique book and patron IDs. That way, for example, if a patron is
registered to two different libraries - library1 and library2, and he borrows a book from library1,
the book's id doesn't exist in library2. Thus, the patron cant return the book to library2.
